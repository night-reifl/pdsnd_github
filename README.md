### Description
Getting Statistics on Bicycle Share in the U.S

<<<<<<< HEAD

In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence and popularity of bicycle-sharing systems in cities worldwide. These systems enable users to rent bicycles for short durations at a cost. This flexibility allows individuals to borrow a bike from one location (point A) and return it at another (point B), although the option to return it to the same location is also available for those simply looking to enjoy a ride. Each bike has the potential to serve multiple users throughout the day.

With the advancement of information technologies, users can easily access system docks to both unlock and return bicycles. These technologies also generate a wealth of data, offering valuable insights into the usage patterns and dynamics of these bike-sharing systems.
